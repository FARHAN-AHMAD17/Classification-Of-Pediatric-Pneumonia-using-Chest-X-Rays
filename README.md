# Pneumonia Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. The model is trained to differentiate between normal and pneumonia-infected lungs, providing an automated and efficient diagnostic tool.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Classification**: Uses CNNs for high-accuracy pneumonia detection.
- **Automated Diagnosis**: Processes chest X-ray images and predicts pneumonia presence.
- **Efficient & Scalable**: Can be extended for real-world applications in medical diagnostics.
- **Visualization**: Includes loss and accuracy plots to track model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized into:
- **Normal**: Healthy lungs.
- **Pneumonia**: Lungs affected by pneumonia.

The dataset used is publicly available and commonly used for pneumonia detection research.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification. Key layers include:
- Convolutional Layers for feature extraction
- Max Pooling Layers for dimensionality reduction
- Fully Connected Layers for classification
- Softmax Activation for probability distribution

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional for image processing)

### Installation
